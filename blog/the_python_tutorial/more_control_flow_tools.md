## Defining Functions

The execution of a function introduces a new symbol table used for the local variables of the function. More precisely, all variable assignments in a function store the value in the local symbol table; **whereas variable references first look in the local symbol table, then in the local symbol tables of enclosing functions, then in the global symbol table, and finally in the table of built-in names**. Thus, global variables and variables of enclosing functions cannot be directly assigned a value within a function (unless, for global variables, named in a `global` statement, or, for variables of enclosing functions, named in a `nonlocal` statement), although they may be referenced.

### Default Argument Values

The default values are evaluated at the point of function definition in the defining scope, so that

```python
i = 5

def f(arg=i):
    print(arg)

i = 6
f()
```

will print 5.

> **Important warning:** The default value is evaluated only once. This makes a difference when the default is a mutable object such as a list, dictionary, or instances of most classes. For example, the following function accumulates the arguments passed to it on subsequent calls:

```python
def f(a, L=[]):
    L.append(a)
    return L

print(f(1))
print(f(2))
print(f(3))
```

This will print

```python
[1]
[1, 2]
[1, 2, 3]
```

If you donâ€™t want the default to be shared between subsequent calls, you can write the function like this instead:

```python
def f(a, L=None):
    if L is None:
        L = []
    L.append(a)
    return L
```

### Keyword Arguments

Functions can also be called using keyword arguments of the form `kwarg=value`.

In a function call, keyword arguments must follow positional arguments. All the keyword arguments passed must match one of the arguments accepted by the function, and their order is not important. This also includes non-optional arguments. No argument may receive a value more than once.

When a final formal parameter of the form `**name` is present, it receives a dictionary containing all keyword arguments except for those corresponding to a formal parameter. This may be combined with a formal parameter of the form `*name` which receives a tuple containing the positional arguments beyond the formal parameter list. (`*name` must occur before `**name`.)

### Arbitrary Argument Lists

Any formal parameters which occur after the `*args` parameter are 'keyword-only' arguments, meaning that they can only be used as keywords rather than positional arguments.

### Unpacking Argument Lists

The reverse situation occurs when the arguments are already in a list or tuple but need to be unpacked for a function call requiring separate positional arguments.
