This module provides direct access to all 'built-in' identifiers of Python; for example, `builtins.open` is the full name for the built-in function `open()`.

> This module is not normally accessed explicitly by most applications, but can be useful in modules that provide objects with the same name as a built-in value, but in which the built-in of that name is also needed.
