## Introducing JSON

**JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.

JSON is built on two structures:

- A collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is realized as an object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array.
- An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence.

In JSON, they take on these forms:

- A **value** can be a string in double quotes, or a number, or true or false or null, or an object or an array. These structures can be nested.
    - A **string** is a sequence of zero or more Unicode characters, wrapped in double quotes, using backslash escapes. A character is represented as a single character string. A string is very much like a C or Java string.
    - A **number** is very much like a C or Java number, except that the octal and hexadecimal formats are not used.
    - An **object** is an unordered set of name/value pairs. An object begins with `{` and ends with `}`. Each name is followed by `:` and the name/value pairs are separated by `,`.
    - An **array** is an ordered collection of values. An array begins with `[` and ends with `]`. Values are separated by `,`.
