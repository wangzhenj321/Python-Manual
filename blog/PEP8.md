    - For consistency, always use `"""triple double quotes"""` around docstrings.
    - Use `r"""raw triple double quotes"""` if you use any backslashes in your docstrings.
    - For Unicode docstrings, use `u"""Unicode triple-quoted strings"""`.
    - One-line Docstrings should really fit on one line.
